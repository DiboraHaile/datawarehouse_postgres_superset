# datawarehouse_postgres_superset
Postgres and Apache Superset Data Warehouse Tech Stack migrated from MySQL and Redash. This project scales the implementation on https://github.com/DiboraHaile/data_warehouse_with_dbt_airflow/ and  https://github.com/DiboraHaile/populate_db_with_airflow which tries to implement ELT pipeline using DBT, AirFlow and Redash. Here In this Project, the database created in MySQL will be migrated to Postgres and similarily redsash to Apache Superset. Hoping this generates more speed and efficiency.
